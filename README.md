### (。_。) Read Me
A long time ago, in a codebase far, far away…

I was once a mere developer, but the flaws of legacy systems and spaghetti code led me to the dark side of engineering. Now, I forge high-performing software teams, or architect and implement distributed systems as vast and unstoppable as the Empire itself.
I have mastered the ways of scalability, efficiency, and ruthless optimization, and I find your lack of clean code disturbing. I do not simply learn - I assimilate knowledge.

### ¯\(°_o)/¯ Things I Wish Someone Told Me Earlier
- **Premature optimization** is the root of all evil.
- Good **software desing** is like a joke - if you have to explain it, it's bad.
- The best **refactor** is the one you don't need.
- Writing **tests** is great, but writing code that doesn't need tests is better.
- A **meeting** that could have been an email or chat is a defect in the process.
- Your **favorite tech stack** is just Stockholm syndrome.
- There's no such thing as **'temporary' code**.
